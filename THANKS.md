## Contributors

Thanks to all past and future contributors for their help
making opal a simple, but great syntax highlighter for
use across the Dart package ecosystem.

## Inspiration

This library is inspired by the capabilities and APIs of
countless syntax highlighting libraries and tools that came before it.
The following is an incomplete list of some of them:

- [Sublime syntax definitions](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/syntax.html)
- [Textmate language grammars](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars)
- [highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js)
- [Rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge)
- [Prism](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism)
- [chromatophore](https://github.com/munificent/journal/tree/master/packages/chromatophore)
